# Getting Started with GameXBuddy Guides

Welcome to your first MDX guide. This page is rendered from a `.mdx` file stored in Supabase Storage and parsed at runtime.

## What You Can Do

- Write headings, paragraphs, and lists
- Add links like [GameXBuddy](https://gamexbuddy.com)
- Include images from `/public` or signed Storage URLs
- Add syntax-highlighted code blocks

## Code Sample (TSX)

```tsx
import React, { useState } from 'react'

export function Counter() {
  const [n, setN] = useState(0)
  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setN(n + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <span style={{ marginLeft: 8 }}>Value: {n}</span>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Tips

- Use fenced code blocks like ```` ```tsx ```` to enable highlighting.
- Keep metadata (title, description, tags) in the database; the renderer uses the DB row for SEO title/description.
- For a cover image, upload an asset to your `media` bucket and set `cover_path` in the `guides` table.

Happy writing!
