    # or pnpm install
    ```
3.  **Set up environment variables**:
    Create a `.env` file in the root of your project based on `.env.example` and fill in your Supabase credentials.
    ```
    VITE_SUPABASE_URL="YOUR_SUPABASE_URL"
    VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="YOUR_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY"
    ```
4.  **Start the development server**:

    # or yarn dev
    # or pnpm dev
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:8080`.

### Admin Picks (curated recommendations)

An internal page exists at `/admin/picks` to manage the curated list in `public.recommended_games`.

- Drag-and-drop to reorder (ranks saved as 1..N)
- Edit badges inline (e.g., "Top Pick", "Editorâ€™s Choice", "ðŸ”¥ Hot Deal", "ðŸ’¸ Great Price")
- Add by slug, or remove an entry

Data model joins `recommended_games` to `games` for titles/covers and writes back via `upsert`.

Important: This page is not protected in this repo by default. Ensure you add auth/role protection before exposing it publicly.

## Environment Variables

Never commit `.env*` files. Keep secrets out of version control. Frontend uses Vite env vars (VITE_*) provided by your host; Edge Functions use Supabase secrets.

### Frontend (.env.local â€” not committed)
Set these in your hosting provider or a local `.env.local` file:

```
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
```

### Edge Functions (Supabase secrets)
Set these in your Supabase project (Dashboard â†’ Edge Functions â†’ Secrets):

- SUPABASE_URL
- SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY
- RAWG_API_KEY
- CHEAPSHARK_BASE (optional, default: https://www.cheapshark.com/api/1.0)

#### One-time setup commands
```
supabase storage create-bucket media --public=false
supabase functions deploy sync-games
supabase secrets set SUPABASE_URL=... SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=... RAWG_API_KEY=...
```

## Auth Setup (Supabase)

Add these Redirect URLs in Supabase Auth settings:

```
http://localhost:5173/auth/callback
https://gamexbuddy.com/auth/callback
```

Grant editor rights (example):

```
update public.profiles set is_editor = true where id = '<USER_UUID>';
```

Notes:
- `/admin/picks` requires login and an editor or moderator role.
- Never expose the service_role key in the client; only Edge Functions should use it.
